# Mouseion Whitepaper

**Version 0.1 - Draft**

## Abstract

Mouseion is a decentralized protocol designed to track contributions to AI systems and distribute royalties fairly to all participants. By leveraging a novel reversible-transaction blockchain, the protocol ensures transparent, auditable, and recoverable payment flows while maintaining data sovereignty for contributors.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Vision

To build a decentralized ecosystem that fairly distributes the value generated by AI development to all contributors: data providers, creators, reviewers, and AI developers.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Current AI systems face fundamental issues:

1. **Absence of Compensation**: Data providers who train AI models receive no appropriate rewards
2. **Lack of Transparency**: No way to track which data was used for AI training or generation
3. **Rights Violations**: Data is used regardless of copyright holders' intentions
4. **Centralized Control**: A few corporations monopolize AI systems
5. **Data Loss**: Service shutdowns or account deletions cause permanent data loss

### 1.3 Value Proposition

Mouseion provides:

- **Data Sovereignty**: Data providers maintain control over their data
- **Fair Rewards**: Transparent reward distribution based on contribution
- **Democratic Governance**: All contributors can participate in system operations
- **Permanent Storage**: Data persists on the blockchain
- **Full Traceability**: Generated content can be traced to its sources

│  Service Layer: AI Royalty Distribution System              │
│  - Contribution Tracking  - Reward Distribution             │
│  - Governance  - Data Management                            │

│  Layer 1: Reversible Transaction Blockchain (TypeScript)     │
│  - Pending Transfers  - Cancellation  - Guardian Approval   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2.2 Integration with Base Chain

The system is built on the "Reversible Transaction Blockchain" foundation:

- **Accidental Transfer Prevention**: Recipient errors can be cancelled
- **Fraud Protection**: Suspicious reward claims can be reviewed and frozen by guardians
- **Pending Transfers**: Confirmation processes can be built into reward receipt

## 3. Core Features

### 3.1 Data Registration and Tagging

#### Registration Metadata

| Field | Description |
|:--|:--|
| Data Body Hash | For tamper detection |
| AI Training Permission Flag | Opt-in/Opt-out |
| Sale Permission Flag | Whether to allow direct data sales |
| Usage Terms | Commercial use, attribution requirements, etc. |
| Category/Tags | Specialty field, data type |
| Provider Public Key | Reward recipient address |

#### Storage Design

- **On-chain**: Metadata, hashes, rights information, contribution records
- **Off-chain**: Data bodies (IPFS, Arweave, or other distributed storage)

### 3.2 Contributor Identification Algorithm

Methods to identify which data contributed to AI outputs:

| Method | Use Case | Characteristics |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Sentence-BERT / Cosine Similarity | Semantic similarity measurement | Text similarity evaluation |
| TF-IDF / Word2Vec | Keyword/tag search | Prompt-data relevance |
| Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN) | Pattern identification | Feature vector classification |
| RAG | Search + Generation combination | Explicit reference data identification |
| Attention Weight Analysis | Transformer models | Input attention tracking |
| Influence Functions | Gradient-based contribution calculation | Training data influence estimation |

#### Technical Challenges and Solutions

- **Computation Cost**: Pre-indexing, approximate nearest neighbor search (ANN)
- **Accuracy Limitations**: Multiple method combination, threshold settings
- **Real-time Processing**: Use-case dependent batch or real-time selection

### 3.3 Reward Distribution System

#### Distribution Flow

```
1. AI service user pays usage fee
2. System identifies data contributors
3. Tokens distributed according to contribution
4. Rewards sent to contributor wallets in pending state
5. Contributors confirm receipt (base chain pending transfer feature)
```

#### Contribution Calculation Factors

- **Data Usage Frequency**: How many times referenced
- **Data Quality Score**: Expert evaluation, community evaluation
- **Similarity Score**: Strength of relevance to generated output
- **Rarity**: Availability of alternative data

### 3.4 Expert Annotation and Evaluation

#### Expert Selection Process

1. List candidates based on classification table (academic fields, industry sectors)
2. Calculate past contribution, evaluation history, expertise score
3. Selection through AI algorithm + community voting
4. Selected experts perform annotations

#### Quality Assurance

- Cross-review by other reviewers
- Annotation reliability score based on evaluation consistency
- Detection and sanctions for fraudulent evaluations

### 3.5 AI Model Version Control

#### Recorded Items

- Model ID, Version Number
- Hash of training dataset
- Training parameters
- Change history (diff)
- Publication timestamp

#### Purpose

- Prevention of silent performance changes
- Users can select specific versions
- Rollback capability when issues occur

### 3.6 Human/AI Data Separation

#### Necessity

- AI trained on AI-generated data risks quality degradation (model collapse)
- Protection of human original data value

#### Implementation

- Mandatory tagging at registration: "Human-created", "AI-generated", "AI-assisted"
- AI-generated data managed in separate index
- Filterable during training

## 4. Token Economics

See [Tokenomics](./tokenomics.md) for detailed token economy design.

## 5. Governance Design

### 5.1 Voting Scope

- AI usage rules establishment and modification
- Data publication/privacy policies
- Fee rate settings
- System upgrade approval
- Classification table updates
- Reward distribution algorithm changes
- System asset management

### 5.2 Voting Mechanisms

| Method | Characteristics | Use Case |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 1 Token = 1 Vote | Simple | General proposals |
| Quadratic Voting | Reduces whale dominance | Important decisions |
| Delegated Voting | Delegation to experts possible | Technical judgments |
| Time-weighted Voting | Favors long-term holders | Long-term proposals |

### 5.3 Whale Dominance Prevention

- **Voting Power Caps**: Maximum voting power per address
- **Quadratic Voting**: Influence calculated by square root of tokens
- **Contribution Weighting**: Consider actual contributions, not just token holdings
- **Cooldown Period**: Restrict voting immediately after large purchases

## 6. Legal and Compliance

### 6.1 Copyright Considerations

- Opt-in approach: Only use data with explicit permission
- Copyright holders can set detailed usage conditions
- Usage history recorded on blockchain for dispute evidence

### 6.2 Data Protection

- GDPR compliance: Off-chain data deletable, on-chain stores only hashes
- Privacy options: Operate with public key only
- Data deletion request handling process

### 6.3 Financial Regulations

- Utility token design to avoid securities classification
- KYC/AML at application layer for high-value transactions

---

## 7. Future Considerations

### Technical
- Contributor identification algorithm accuracy benchmarks
- Off-chain storage selection (IPFS vs Arweave vs custom)
- Large dataset performance verification
- Privacy technology selection (ZKP, homomorphic encryption)

### Economic
- Token initial pricing methodology
- Reward pool depletion countermeasures
- Data value evaluation criteria

### Governance
- Initial guardian selection method
- Fork handling procedures
- Malicious proposal countermeasures
